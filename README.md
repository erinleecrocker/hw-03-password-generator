# hw-03-password-generator

Purpose of this project is to create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria.

first my goal is to figure out how to do this! I was provided with the HTML, and CSS set up but now need to edit the index.js file to make it work!

I started with generate password funciton, I needed a prompt asking for the password size (between 8 and 128) then I needed an alert if the user entered something outside of that range. 

following this; as long as the user input a correct character amount I needed cofirms on the other criteria to know what should and shouldnt be included. 

Although now im a bit confused and need to do a bit more googling before i understand how to get all these to do more than show up in the console.log.  Where do i store this information so that when the password is generated all these factors are taken in together? hmm.
